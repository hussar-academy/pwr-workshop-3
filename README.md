$ cd pwr-workshop-3
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec rake db:setup

## Database

The default database adapter is MySQL. If you want to use Postgresql or SQLite you can find configs in `config/` directory.

```
$ ls config/
database.yml
database.psql.yml
database.sqlite.yml
```

The `database.yml` file is config that is used, so you can just replace it with the one you wish to use.
